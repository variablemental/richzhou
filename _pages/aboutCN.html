About me
======
Hello everyone. Nice to see you on my homepage. I am Jianhang Zhou, you can also call me _Rich_ as my nickname. I was born in Shanghai and have multiple research experiences in different institutions/regions. In 2023, I obtained my Ph.D. degree in computer science from the University of Macau. Afterward, I worked as a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at Osaka University (Japan, 2024-2025). I also have experience as a visiting researcher at the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), Shenzhen. Currently, I am an assistant professor in Shanghai University. I generally work on subspace learning, sparse learning, green learning, and medical biometrics. Recently, I also have related experience in developing methodology/algorithm/system of [cybernetics avatar](https://avatar-life.jp/) (supported by the [JST Moonshot project](https://www8.cao.go.jp/cstp/english/moonshot/sub1_en.html)). For my daily life, I like hiking, traveling, coffee time, and anything fresh & interesting. I am fond of collaborating with others with different research directions/subjects (e.g., medicine science, brain science, etc.). If you have some interest in working/collaborating with me, you are always welcome! ;)
