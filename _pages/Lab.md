❔ What is I<sup>2</sup>BP<sup>2</sup> Research Group?
======

In Identity Intelligence & Biometrics Pattern Perception Research Group ($I^2BP^2$), we struggle to answer the scientific questions:
- What is the natural representation of identity in different species (human being, marine life, etc.)?
- IS it possible for us to extract a unique biometric pattern for each identity from a highly diverse and complicated environment?
- What decides the better biometric pattern? Nature-based or Application-driven?


The Motto of our group is: 

🙋 Who are we?
======

We are a research group that belongs to Shanghai University (SHU). We have 3 members (quite tiny!) at present but will expand very soon. 

🔍 What we do?
======

Currently, we are focusing on the research topics as follows:

* Medical Biometrics
* Gait Analysis
* Avatar/Talking-head generation and verification
* Privacy-preserving Biometric Systems
* Green Learning
* Dictionary Learning and Sparse Representation
* Affective computing
* 

💰 Who supports us?
======
We are funded and supported by multiple institutions and departments, including the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC), Shanghai Government, and Shanghai University, etc. Followings are our supporters:

* Research on Green Learning for Medical Biometrics and applications, Natural Science Foundation of Youth Scientist Program, NSFC, 2026-2028, PI
* Shanghai Overseas Talents Program, Shanghai Government, 2026-2028, PI


👋 Why join us?
======
Want to join us? Here is the useful recruiting information of our lab: 

We are recruiting highly motivated post-graduate students and BSc students (B3/B4) who are passionate about doing research on Biometrics, Pattern analysis, and privacy-preserving identity science. If you have any interests, please don't hesitate to contact me via email.

[For BSc students]: 
I prefer B3/B4 students who are highly self-motivated to seek research experience. We have multiple research projects and topics for you, with different difficulty levels. We offer rich opportunities for exchanges, collaborations with national Universities and overseas institutions.

I will post the vacancies as soon as they are available. Please stay tuned.

[For Chinese Nationals MSc students]: 

I will post the vacancies as soon as they are available. Please stay tuned. 

[For International]: 

I also welcome international students to join us to enhance the diversity of our group. The first language of our group is English for academic use, so feel free to contact me. 

🤝 Who we collaborate with?
======
We currently collaborate with several universities, institutions, and research groups all over the world 🌍. Followings are our collaborators:
