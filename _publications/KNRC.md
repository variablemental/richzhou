We proposed a Kernel Non-negative Representation-based Classifier (KNRC) for addressing this problem to achieve better results in pattern classification. Furthermore, we extended the KNRC to a dimensionality reduction version to reduce the dimensions of the KNRC’s feature space as well as improve its classification ability.
