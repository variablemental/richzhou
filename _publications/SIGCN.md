excerpt: 'we apply unified GR techniques and GCNs in a framework that can be implemented in semisupervised learning problems. To achieve this framework, we propose sparsity-induced graph convolutional network (SIGCN) for semisupervised learning. SIGCN introduces the sparsity to formulate significant relationships between instances by constructing a newly proposed $L_0$ -based graph (termed as the sparsity-induced graph) before applying graph convolution to capture the high-quality features based on this graph for label propagation.'

The two-stage strategy has been widely used in image classification. However, these methods barely take the classification criteria of the first stage into consideration in the second prediction stage. In this paper, we propose a novel Two-Stage Representation method (TSR), and convert it to a Single-Teacher SingleStudent (STSS) problem in our two-stage knowledge transfer framework for image classification.
